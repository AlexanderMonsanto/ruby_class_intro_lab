## Exercises Using Classes

###SuperHero
* Create a class called `SuperHero` that takes a `firstName` and `lastName`. Give each superHero a `superPunch` method that returns `"WHAM!"`.

###Robot
* Create a class called `Robot` that takes `name` and `purpose`. Give each robot a `greet` method that returns `"beep boop"`

###Starship
* Make a `Starship` class that takes a `model` and `ownerName`. 
  * Give your `StarShip` a `setTopSpeed` method and a `getTopSpeedMethod` that let you change and read the `topSpeed`. *Assume `topSpeed` is just a number.*
  
  * Give your `Starship` an `accelerateTo` method that sets `currentSpeed` to some number, unless that number is greater than its `topSpeed`.
  
###Dice
* Make a `Dice` class that takes a `numberOfSides`. Add a method called `roll` that randomly returns a number from `1` up to the `numberOfSides`.
  * Create a `getRolls` method to record that returns (not outputs) a list of arrays containing previous rolls.
